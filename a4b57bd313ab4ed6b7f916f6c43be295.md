A composable function: \\\n- Describe part of your UI.\\\n- Doesn't return anything.\\\n- Takes some input  and generate what's shown on screen.\\\n\\\n---\\\nAnnotations are means of attaching extra information to code. The information helps tools like Jetpack Compose compilier, and other develpers understand the app's code. \\\n\\\nAn  annotation is applied by prefixing it's name (the annotation) with `@` character at the beginning of the declaration you are annotating. **Different code elements including properties, functions, and classes can be annotated.**\\\n\\\nThe following code block is an example of annotated function:\\\n```\\\n@Composable\\\nfun Greeting(name: String, modifier: Modifier) {}\\\n\\\n```\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":181,\"start2\":181,\"length1\":8,\"length2\":925}]"
