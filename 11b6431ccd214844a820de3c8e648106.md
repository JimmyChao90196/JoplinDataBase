01. What is jetpack compose ?

Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building android UIs. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools and intuitive Kotlin capabilities. With Compose you can build your UIs by defining a set of functions, called composable functions, that take in data and describe UI elements.


### Composable functions
Composable functions are the basic building block of a UI in Compose. A composable function: 
- Describe part of your UI.
- Doesn't return anything.
- Takes some input  and generate what's shown on screen.

Annotations are means of attaching extra information to code. The information helps tools like Jetpack Compose compilier, and other develpers understand the app's code. 

An  annotation is applied by prefixing it's name (the annotation) with `@` character at the beginning of the declaration you are annotating. **Different code elements including properties, functions, and classes can be annotated.**

The following code block is an example of annotated function:
```
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String, modifier: Modifier) {}

```

The following code snippet has example of annotated properties. You'll be using these in the coming codelabs.
```
@Json
val imageSrcUrl: String

@Volatile
private var INSTANCE: AppDataBase? = null
```

Annotations can take parameters. Parameters provide extra information to the tools processing them. The following are some examples of the `@Preview` annotation with and without parameters.

```
@Preview
@Composable
fun GreetingPreview() {
	HappyBirthdayTheme() {
		Greeting(name: "Android")
	}
}

@Preview(showBackGround = true)
@Composable
fun GreetingPreview() {
	HappyBirthdayTheme() {
		Greeting(name: "Android")
	}
}

@Preview(name = "My preview")
@Composable
fun GreetingPreview() {
	HappyBirthdayTheme() {
		Greeting(name: "Android")
	}
}

```
You can pass multiple arguements to the annotation, as shown here.
```
@Preview(
	showBackground = true,
	showSystemUi = true,
	name = "My Preview"
)
@Composable
fun GreetingPreview() {
	HappyBirthdayTheme() {
		Greeting(name: "Android")
	}
}
```

JetPack Compose includes a wide range of built-in annotations, you have already seen `@Preview` and `@Composable` annotations so far in the course. You will learn more annotations and their usages in the latter part of the course.

### Example of a composable function
The composable function is annotated with `@Composable` annotation. All composable function must have ths annotation. This annotation informs the Compose compiler that this function is intended to convert data into UI. As a reminder, a compiler is a special program that takes the code your wrote, looks at it line by line, and translates it into something the computer can understand (machine language).

This code snippet is an example of a simple composable function that is passed data( the name function parameter) and use it to render a text element on screen.

```
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
	Text("Hello $name")
}
```
